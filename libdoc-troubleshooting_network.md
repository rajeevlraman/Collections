## Networking Fundamentals

### Understanding Network Setup

1. **Question: Can you explain the difference between LAN and WAN, and how you might configure each?**

   **Answer:**
   - **Local Area Network (LAN)** connects computers within a limited area such as a single building or a group of buildings. It's typically used in a home, school, or office. LANs use Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi to connect devices.
   - **Wide Area Network (WAN)** covers a broader geographic area and connects multiple LANs. The internet is the largest WAN. WANs often use technologies like MPLS, VPNs, and leased lines for connectivity.
   
   **Example:**
   - For a LAN setup, I would configure a router with a DHCP server to assign IP addresses dynamically to connected devices, ensure the correct subnet mask and default gateway are set, and configure any necessary firewall rules.
   - For a WAN setup, I would establish the necessary connections between different locations using VPNs or MPLS, configure routers with static or dynamic routing protocols to manage traffic, and ensure security policies are in place for data transmission across the network.

2. **Question: Describe the steps you would take to troubleshoot a network connectivity issue in a LAN environment.**

   **Answer:**
   - **Step 1: Check Physical Connections**: Ensure all cables are properly connected and there are no visible damages.
   - **Step 2: Verify IP Configuration**: Use the `ipconfig` or `ifconfig` command to check the IP settings on the affected device.
   - **Step 3: Ping Test**: Ping the local gateway and other devices on the LAN to determine if the issue is isolated to a single device or affects multiple devices.
   - **Step 4: Check Network Devices**: Verify the status of network devices such as routers and switches. Use tools like `traceroute` or `tracert` to diagnose where the connection fails.
   - **Step 5: Review DHCP and DNS Settings**: Ensure that the DHCP server is assigning IP addresses correctly and DNS servers are resolving domain names properly.
   - **Step 6: Examine Network Security**: Check firewall settings and security policies that might be blocking traffic.

   **Example:**
   - I had a case where users were unable to access a file server on the LAN. I started by checking the physical connections and found no issues. Using `ipconfig`, I noticed that several devices had IP conflicts. I then verified the DHCP settings on the router and found an incorrect scope configuration causing the conflicts. After adjusting the DHCP settings and rebooting the affected devices, the issue was resolved.
